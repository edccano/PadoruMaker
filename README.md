You can also build the app manually.
## Instructions
In `Padoru Maker\PadoruMaker_Data\Resources\`, there are three folders: 
- AudioClip
- BackGround
- Character

Change the images & audio as required while keeping the same filename (lowercase) & fileformat (png & wav only currently), restart the program or press Reload once you change the data.

Character needs 4 sprites for the rotation animation, if only one sprite is available then make duplicates & name them like in the folder.

## Video Capture
I did not add video capturing capabilities due to licensing complications (FFmpeg), you can use windows 10 game DVR or external software like obs or nvidia shadowplay to record the meme.

## Any new plans?
Functionality is very basic now, will add effects and more options in the future when I get time. If you are interested in adding new features then go ahead and sent me a pull request.
